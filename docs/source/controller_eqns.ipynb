    "Controllers are used to determine the type of high-level control over a given robot arm. While all arms are directly controlled via their joint torques, the inputted action space for a given environment can vary depending on the type of desired control. Our controller options include `EEImpedance`, `EEPosture`, `JointImpedance`, `JointVelocity`, and `JointTorque`. \n",

    "For research purposes, robotic control is the action-space of robotic learning. The controller libraries exist to unify controllers across different experiments and robot configurations. They also create transparency for ease of debugging.\n",
    "All controllers in this use joint torque as an output control command. Because of the nature of torque control, control commands should be sent to the robot at a high frequency (>100 Hz, preferably 500-1000Hz).\n",

    "Controllers are only tuned to provide good performance at small displacements from the current state. Interpolators are used to smooth commands sent to the controllers. This is important as interpolation occurs between consecutive goal commands, rather than between the current state and goal state. This may result in non-markovian behavior, as the next action is dependent on the previous action commanded. We interpolate the goals rather than the current states to produce a smooth trajectory for the robot.  \n",

    "During runtime, the execution of the controllers is as follows. Controllers receive a desired configuration (reference value) and output joint torques that try to minimize the error between the current configuration and the desired one. Policies and solutions provide these desired configurations, elements of some action space, at what we call policy frequency ($f_{p}$), e.g., 20Hz or 30Hz. **perls2** will execute several iterations composed of a controller execution and a simulation step at simulation frequency, $f_s$ ($f_s = N\\cdot f_p$), using the same reference signal until a new action is provided by the policy/solution. In these iterations, while the desired configuration is kept constant, the current state of the robot is changing, and thus, the error.\n",

We follow the formalism from [\\[Khatib87\\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1087068). Our control frame is always the `eef_site` defined in the gripper model, placed at the end of the last link for robots without gripper or between the fingers for robots with gripper. The operational space control framework (OSC) computes the necessary joint torques to minimize the error between the desired and the current pose of the `eef_site` with the minimal kinematic energy. \n",

For that, we first decompose into a desired position, $p_d \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, and a desired orientation, $R_d \\in \\mathbb{SO}(3)$. The end-effector acceleration to minimize the error should increase with the difference between desired end-effector pose and current pose, $p$ and $R$ (proportional term), and decrease with the current end-effector velocity, $v$ and $\\omega$ (derivative term).\n",

    "We then compute the robot actuation (joint torques) to achieve the desired end-effector space accelerations leveraging the kinematic and dynamic models of the robot with the dynamically-consistent operational space formulation in [\\[Khatib1995a\\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/027836499501400103).
