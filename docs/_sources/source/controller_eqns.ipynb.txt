    "Controllers are used to determine the type of high-level control over a given robot arm. While all arms are directly controlled via their joint torques, the inputted action space for a given environment can vary depending on the type of desired control. Our controller options include `EEImpedance`, `EEPosture`, `JointImpedance`, `JointVelocity`, and `JointTorque`.\n",

    "## Controllers\n",
    "\n",
    "During runtime, the execution of the controllers is as follows. Controllers receive a desired configuration (reference value) and output joint torques that try to minimize the error between the current configuration and the desired one. Policies and solutions provide these desired configurations, elements of some action space, at what we call simulated policy frequency ($f_{p}$), e.g., 20Hz or 30Hz. **robosuite** will execute several iterations composed of a controller execution and a simulation step at simulation frequency, $f_s$ ($f_s = N\\cdot f_p$), using the same reference signal until a new action is provided by the policy/solution. In these iterations, while the desired configuration is kept constant, the current state of the robot is changing, and thus, the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we summarize the options, variables, and the control laws (equations) that convert desired values from the policy/solution and current robot states into executable joint torques to minimize the difference.\n",

    "Since our controllers transform the desired values from the policies/solutions into joint torques, if these values are already joint torques, there is a one-to-one mapping between the reference value from the policy/solution and the output value from the joint torque controller at each step: $\\tau = \\tau_d$\n",

    "To control joint velocities, we create a proportional (P) control law between the desired value provided by the policy/solution (interpreted as desired velocity of each joint) and the current joint velocity of the robot. This control law, parameterized by a proportional constant, $k_p$, generates joint torques to execute at each simulation step:\n",

    "### Operational Space Control - Pose with Fixed Impedance\n",

    "Action Dimensions (not including gripper): `6`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `OSC_POSE` controller, the desired value is the 6D pose (position and orientation) of a controlled frame. We follow the formalism from [\\[Khatib87\\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1087068). Our control frame is always the `eef_site` defined in the gripper model, placed at the end of the last link for robots without gripper or between the fingers for robots with gripper. The operational space control framework (OSC) computes the necessary joint torques to minimize the error between the desired and the current pose of the `eef_site` with the minimal kinematic energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a desired pose $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathit{des}}$ and the current end-effector pose, , we first compute the end-effector acceleration that would help minimize the error between both, assumed. PD (proportional-derivative) control schema to improve convergence and stability. For that, we first decompose into a desired position, $p_d \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, and a desired orientation, $R_d \\in \\mathbb{SO}(3)$. The end-effector acceleration to minimize the error should increase with the difference between desired end-effector pose and current pose, $p$ and $R$ (proportional term), and decrease with the current end-effector velocity, $v$ and $\\omega$ (derivative term).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then compute the robot actuation (joint torques) to achieve the desired end-effector space accelerations leveraging the kinematic and dynamic models of the robot with the dynamically-consistent operational space formulation in [\\[Khatib1995a\\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/027836499501400103). First, we compute the wrenches at the end-effector that corresponds to the desired accelerations, ${f}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{6}$.\n",
    "Then, we map the wrenches in end-effector space ${f}$ to joint torque commands with the end-effector Jacobian at the current joint configuration $J=J(q)$: $\\tau = J^T{f}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the function that maps end-effector space position and orientation to low-level robot commands is ($\\textrm{ee} = \\textrm{\\it end-effector space}$):\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\tau &= J_p[\\Lambda_p[k_p^p (p_d - p) - k_v^p v]] + J_R[\\Lambda_R\\left[k_p^R(R_d \\ominus R) - k_d^R \\omega \\right]]\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\Lambda_p$ and $\\Lambda_R$ are the parts corresponding to position and orientation in $\\Lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6\\times6}$, the inertial matrix in the end-effector frame that decouples the end-effector motions, $J_p$ and $J_R$ are the position and orientation parts of the end-effector Jacobian, and $\\ominus$ corresponds to the subtraction in $\\mathbb{SO}(3)$. The difference between current and desired position ($\\Delta_p= p_d - p$) and between current and desired orientation ($\\Delta_R = R_d \\ominus R$) can be used as alternative policy action space, $\\mathcal{A}$. $k_p^p$, $k_p^d$, $k_p^R$, and $k_d^R$ are vectors of proportional and derivative gains for position and orientation (parameters $\\kappa$), respectively, set once at initialization and kept fixed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Controller Type: `EEPosture`\n",

    "Impedance: Fixed\n",

    "The control law is the same as `EEImpedance` but, in this case the posture, or joint position of the robot provides an additional constraint. The torques required to maintain the joint positions are mapped to the nullspace of the taskspace and therefore do not interfere with the robot's ability to acheive the desired goal. \n",

    "## Configurations\n",
    "The config directory (found within the controller module) provides a set of default configuration files that hold default examples of parameters relevant to individual controllers. Note that when creating your controller config templates of a certain type of controller, the listed parameters in the default example are required and should be specified accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Each robot has its own default controller configuration which is called by default unless a different controller config is called.\n",

    "Below, a brief overview and description of each subset of controller parameters are shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Controller Settings  \n",
    "* `type`: Type of controller to control. Can be `OSC_POSE`, `OSC_POSITION`, `IK_POSE`, `JOINT_POSITION`, `JOINT_VELOCITY`, or `JOINT_TORQUE`\n",
    "* `interpolation`: If not `null`, specified type of interpolation to use between desired actions. Currently only `linear` is supported.\n",
    "* `ramp_ratio`: If using `linear` interpolation, specifies the proportion of allotted timesteps (value from [0, 1]) over which to execute the interpolated commands.\n",
    "* `{...}_limits`: Limits for that specific controller. E.g.: for a `JOINT_POSITION`, the relevant limits are its joint positions, `qpos_limits` . Can be either a 2-element list (same min/max limits across entire relevant space), or a list of lists (specific limits for each component)\n",
    "* `ik_{pos, ori}_limit`: Only applicable for IK controller. Limits the magnitude of the desired relative change in position / orientation.\n",
    "* `{input,output}_{min,max}`: Scaling ranges for mapping action space inputs into controller inputs. Settings these limits will automatically clip the action space input to be within the `input_{min,max}` before mapping the requested value into the specified `output_{min,max}` range. Can be either a scalar (same limits across entire action space), or a list (specific limits for each action component)\n",
    "* `kp`: Where relevant, specifies the proportional gain for the controller. Can be either be a scalar (same value for all controller dimensions), or a list (specific values for each dimension)\n",
    "* `damping_ratio`: Where relevant, specifies the damping ratio constant for the controller.\n",
    "* `impedance_mode`: For impedance-based controllers (`OSC_*`, `JOINT_POSITION`), determines the impedance mode for the controller, i.e. the nature of the impedance parameters. It can be `fixed`, `variable`, or `variable_kp` (kd is adjusted to provide critically damped behavior).\n",
    "* `kp_limits, damping_ratio_limits`: Only relevant if `impedance_mode` is set to `variable` or `variable_kp`. Sets the limits for the resulting action space for variable impedance gains.\n",
    "* `control_delta`: Only relevant for `OSC_POSE` or `OSC_POSITION` controllers. `true` interprets input actions as delta values from the current robot end-effector position. Otherwise, assumed to be absolute (global) values\n",
    "* `uncouple_pos_ori`: Only relevant for `OSC_POSE`. `true` decouples the desired position and orientation torques when executing the controller\n"
