# Examples: Objects

## Description
This example shows the different ways to work with objects within a perls2 environment. Objects, and object interfaces are specific to simulation environments as it's difficult to immediately obtain information about object state in the real world. There are several ways to load objects in perls2, either automatically from a configuration file or within an environment.
